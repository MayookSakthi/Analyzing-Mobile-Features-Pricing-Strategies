Smartphone pricing is driven by hardware specs, brand reputation, local demand, and economic conditions. My project investigates how these factors shape pricing strategies globallyâ€”with a special focus on India's dynamic market. By comparing global trends with India's evolving smartphone landscape, I aim to uncover actionable insights that help businesses optimize their pricing and empower consumers to make informed decisions.
